<p>Riding on the Grand
Trunk Railway a few
weeks ago, going from
Suspension Bridge to
Chicago, I saw a sight
so trivial that it seems
unworthy of mention.
Yet for three weeks I
have remembered it,
and so now I’ll relate it, in order to get
rid of it.</p>

<p>And possibly these little incidents of life
are the items that make or mar existence.
</p><p>But here is what I saw on that railroad
train: five children, the oldest a girl of
ten, and the youngest a baby boy of three.
They were traveling alone and had come
from Germany, duly tagged, ticketed and
certified.</p>

<p>They were going to their Grandmother
at Waukegan, Illinois.</p>

<p>The old lady was to meet them in Chicago.</p>

<p>The children spoke not a word of
English, but there is a universal language
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page10" id="page10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the heart that speaks and is understood.
So the trainmen and the children were on
very chummy terms.</p>

<p>Now, at London, Ontario, our train waited
an hour for the Toronto and Montreal
connections.</p>

<p>Just before we reached London, I saw
the Conductor take the three smallest
little passengers to the washroom at the
end of the car, roll up their sleeves,
turn their collars in, and duly wash their
hands and faces. Then he combed their
hair. They accepted the situation as if
they belonged to the Conductor’s family,
as of course they did for the time being.
It was a domestic scene that caused the
whole car to smile, and made everybody
know everybody else. A touch of nature
makes a whole coach kin.</p>

<p>The children had a bushel-basket full
of eatables, but at London that Conductor
took the whole brood over to the dining-hall
for supper, and I saw two fat men
scrap as to who should have the privilege
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page11" id="page11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of paying for the kiddies’ suppers. The
children munched and smiled and said
little things to each other in Teutonic
whispers. </p><p>After our train left London
and the Conductor had taken up his
tickets, he came back, turned over two
seats and placed the cushions lengthwise.
One of the trainmen borrowed a couple of
blankets from the sleeping-cars, and with
the help of three volunteered overcoats,
the babies were all put to bed, and duly
tucked in.</p>

<p>I went back to my Pullman, and went to
bed. And as I dozed off I kept wondering
whether the Grandmother would be there
in the morning to meet the little travelers.
What sort of disaster had deprived them
of parents, I did not know, nor did I care
to ask. The children were alone, but
among friends. They were strong and
well, but they kept very close together
and looked to the oldest girl as a mother.</p>

<p>But to be alone in Chicago would be
terrible! Would she come!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page12" id="page12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
And so I slept. In the morning there was
another Conductor in charge, a man I had
not before seen. I went into the day-coach,
thinking that the man might not know
about the babies, and that I might possibly
help the little immigrants. But my services
were not needed. The ten-year-old “little
other mother” had freshened up her
family, and the Conductor was assuring
them, in awfully bad German, that their
Grandmother would be there—although,
of course, he didn’t know anything at
all about it.</p>

<p>When the train pulled into the long
depot and stopped, the Conductor took
the baby boy on one arm and a little
girl on the other.</p>

<p>A porter carried the big lunch-basket, and
the little other mother led a toddler on each
side, dodging the hurrying passengers.</p>

<p>Evidently I was the only spectator of the
play.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Will she be there—will she be there?”
I asked myself nervously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page13" id="page13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
She was there, all right, there at the
gate. The Conductor was seemingly as
gratified as I. He turned his charges
over to the old woman, who was weeping
for joy, and hugging the children between
bursts of lavish, loving Deutsch.</p>

<p>I climbed into a Parmelee bus and said,
“Auditorium Annex, please.”</p>

<p>And as I sat there in the bus, while they
were packing the grips on top, the
Conductor passed by, carrying a tin
box in one hand and his train cap in
the other.</p>

<p>I saw an Elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.</p>

<p>I called to him, “I saw you help the
babies—good boy!”</p>

<p>He looked at me in doubt.</p>

<p>“Those German children,” I said; “I’m
glad you were so kind to them!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he answered, smiling; “yes, I had
forgotten; why, of course, that is a
railroad man’s business, you know—to
help everybody who needs help.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand and disappeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page14" id="page14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
up the stairway that led to the offices.
</p><p>And it came to me that he had forgotten
the incident so soon, simply because to
help had become the habit of his life.
He may read this, and he may not.
There he was—big, bold, bluff and
bronzed, his hair just touched with the
frost of years, and beneath his brass
buttons a heart beating with a desire
to bless and benefit. I do not know
his name, but the sight of the man,
carrying a child on each arm, their
arms encircling his neck in perfect faith,
their long journey done, and he turning
them over in safety to their Grandmother,
was something to renew one’s faith in
humanity.</p>

<p>Even a great Railway System has a soul.</p>

<p>If you answer that corporations have
no souls, I’ll say: “Friend, you were
never more mistaken in your life. The
business that has no soul soon ceases to
exist; and the success of a company or
corporation turns on the kind of soul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page15" id="page15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
it possesses. Soul is necessary to service.
Courtesy, kindness, honesty and efficiency
are tangible soul-assets; and all good
railroad men know it.”</p>

<p>To stand by the open
grave of one you have
loved, and feel the sky
shut down over less
worth in the world is
the supreme test.</p>

<p>There you prove your
worth, if ever.</p>

<p>You must live and face
the day, and face each succeeding day,
realizing that “the moving finger writes,
and having writ moves on, nor all your
tears shall blot a line of it.”</p>

<p>Heroes are born, but it is calamity that
discovers them.</p>

<p>Once in Western Kansas, in the early
Eighties, I saw a loaded four-horse wagon
skid and topple in going across a gully.
</p><p>The driver sprang from his seat and
tried to hold the wagon upright.</p>

<p>The weight was too great for his strength,
powerful man though he was.</p>

<p>The horses swerved down the ditch
instead of crossing it, and the overturning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page20" id="page20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
wagon caught the man and pinned him
to the ground.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of us sprang from our
horses. After much effort the tangled
animals were unhitched and the wagon
was righted.</p>

<p>The man was dead.</p>

<p>In the wagon were
the wife and six children, the oldest child
a boy of fifteen. All were safely caught
in the canvas top and escaped unhurt.
We camped there—not knowing what
else to do.</p>

<p>We straightened the mangled form of
the dead, and covered the body with
a blanket.</p>

<p>That night the mother and the oldest boy
sat by the campfire and watched the long
night away with their dead.</p>

<p>The stars marched in solemn procession
across the sky.</p>

<p>The slow, crawling night passed.</p>

<p>The first faint flush of dawn appeared
in the East.</p>

<p>I lay near the campfire, my head pillowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page21" id="page21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
on a saddle, and heard the widowed
mother and her boy talking in low but
earnest tones.</p>

<p>“We must go back—we must go back
to Illinois. It is the only thing to do,”
I heard the mother moan.</p>

<p>And the boy answered: “Mother, listen
to what I say: We will go on—we will
go on. We know where father was going
to take us—we know what he was going
to do. We will go on, and we will do
what he intended to do, and if possible
we will do it better. We will go on!”
</p><p>That first burst of pink in the East
had turned to gold.</p>

<p>Great streaks of light stretched from
horizon to zenith.</p>

<p>I could see in the dim and hazy light
the hobbled horses grazing across the
plain a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>The boy of fifteen arose and put fuel
on the fire.</p>

<p>After breakfast I saw that boy get a spade,
a shovel and a pick out of the wagon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page22" id="page22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
With help of others a grave was dug
there on the prairie.</p>

<p>The dead was rolled in a blanket and
tied about with thongs, after the fashion
of the Indians.</p>

<p>Lines were taken from a harness, and
we lowered the body into the grave.
</p><p>The grave was filled up by friendly
hands working in nervous haste.</p>

<p>I saw the boy pat down the mound
with the back of a spade.</p>

<p>I saw him carve with awkward, boyish
hands the initials of his father, the date
of his birth and the day of his death.
</p><p>I saw him drive the slab down at the
head of the grave.</p>

<p>I saw him harness the four horses.</p>

<p>I saw him help his little brothers into
the canvas-covered wagon.</p>

<p>I saw him help his mother climb the
wheel as she took her place on the seat.
</p><p>I saw him spring up beside her.</p>

<p>I saw him gather up the lines in his brown,
slim hands, and swing the whip over the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page23" id="page23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
leaders, as he gave the shrill word of
command and turned the horses to the
West.</p>

<p>And the cavalcade moved forward to the
West—always to the West.</p>

<p>The boy had met calamity and disaster.
He had not flinched.</p>

<p>In a single day he had left boyhood behind
and become a man.</p>

<p>And the years that followed proved him
genuine.</p>

<p>What was it worked the change? Grief
and responsibility, nobly met.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>Simeon Stylites The Syrian</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>As the traveler journeys
through Southern Italy,
Sicily and certain parts
of what was Ancient
Greece, he will see
broken arches, parts
of viaducts, and now
and again a beautiful
column pointing to the
sky. All about is the desert, or solitary
pastures, and only this white milestone
marking the path of the centuries and
telling in its own silent, solemn and
impressive way of a day that is dead.</p>

<p>In the Fifth Century a monk called
Simeon the Syrian, and known to us
as Simeon Stylites, having taken the vow
of chastity, poverty and obedience, began
to fear greatly lest he might not be true
to his pledge. And that he might live
absolutely beyond reproach, always in
public view, free from temptation, and
free from the tongue of scandal, he
decided to live in the world, and still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page28" id="page28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
not be of it. To this end he climbed to
the top of a marble column, sixty feet
high, and there on the capstone he began
to live a life beyond reproach.</p>

<p>Simeon was then twenty-four years old.
</p><p>The environment was circumscribed, but
there were outlook, sunshine, ventilation—three
good things. But beyond these
the place had certain disadvantages. The
capstone was a little less than three feet
square, so Simeon could not lie down.
He slept sitting, with his head bowed
between his knees, and, indeed, in this
posture he passed most of his time. Any
recklessness in movement, and he would
have slipped from his perilous position
and been dashed to death upon the stones
beneath.</p>

<p>As the sun arose he stood up, just for a
few moments, and held out his arms in
greeting, blessing and in prayer. Three
times during the day did he thus stretch
his cramped limbs, and pray with his
face to the East. At such times, those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page29" id="page29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
who stood near shared in his prayers, and
went away blessed and refreshed.</p>

<p>How did Simeon get to the top of the
column?</p>

<p>Well, his companions at the monastery,
a mile away, said he was carried there
in the night by a miraculous power;
that he went to sleep in his stone cell
and awoke on the pillar. Other monks
said that Simeon had gone to pay his
respects to a fair lady, and in wrath
God had caught him and placed him
on high. The probabilities are, however,
Terese, as viewed by an unbeliever, that
he shot a line over the column with a
bow and arrow and then drew up a rope
ladder and ascended with ease.</p>

<p>However, in the morning the simple people
of the scattered village saw the man on the
column.</p>

<p>All day he stayed there.</p>

<p>And the next day he was still there.</p>

<p>The days passed, with the scorching
heat of the midday sun, and the cool
winds of the night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page30" id="page30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Still Simeon kept his place.</p>

<p>The rainy season came on. When the nights were cold
and dark, Simeon sat there with bowed
head, and drew the folds of his single
garment, a black robe, over his face.</p>

<p>Another season passed; the sun again
grew warm, then hot, and the sandstorms
raged and blew, when the people
below almost lost sight of the man on
the column. Some prophesied he would
be blown off, but the morning light
revealed his form, naked from the waist
up, standing with hands outstretched to
greet the rising sun.</p>

<p>Once each day, as darkness gathered, a
monk came with a basket containing a
bottle of goat’s milk and a little loaf of
black bread, and Simeon dropped down
a rope and drew up the basket.</p>

<p>Simeon never spoke, for words are folly,
and to the calls of saint or sinner he
made no reply. He lived in a perpetual
attitude of adoration.</p>

<p>Did he suffer? During those first weeks he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page31" id="page31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
must have suffered terribly and horribly.
There was no respite nor rest from the
hard surface of the rock, and aching
muscles could find no change from the
cramped and perilous position. If he fell,
it was damnation for his soul—all were
agreed as to this.</p>

<p>But man’s body and mind accommodate
themselves to almost any condition. One
thing at least, Simeon was free from
economic responsibilities, free from social
cares and intrusion. Bores with sad stories
of unappreciated lives and fond hopes
unrealized, never broke in upon his peace.
He was not pressed for time. No frivolous
dame of tarnished fame sought to share
with him his perilous perch. The people
on a slow schedule, ten minutes late, never
irritated his temper. His correspondence
never got in a heap.</p>

<p>Simeon kept no track of the days, having
no engagements to meet, nor offices to
perform, beyond the prayers at morn,
midday and night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page32" id="page32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Memory died in him, the hurts became
callouses, the world-pain died out of his
heart, and to cling became a habit.</p>

<p>Language was lost in disuse.</p>

<p>The food he ate was minimum in quantity;
sensation ceased, and the dry, hot winds
reduced bodily tissue to a dessicated
something called a saint—loved, feared
and reverenced for his fortitude.</p>

<p>This pillar, which had once graced the
portal of a pagan temple, again became
a place of pious pilgrimage, and people
flocked to Simeon’s rock, so that they
might be near when he stretched out
his black, bony hands to the East, and
the spirit of Almighty God, for a space,
hovered close around.</p>

<p>So much attention did the abnegation of
Simeon attract that various other pillars,
marking the ruins of art and greatness
gone, in that vicinity, were crowned
with pious monks. The thought of these
monks was to show how Christianity
had triumphed over heathenism. Imitators
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page33" id="page33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were numerous. About then the Bishops
in assembly asked, “Is Simeon sincere?”
To test the matter of Simeon’s pride, he
was ordered to come down from his
retreat.</p>

<p>As to his chastity, there was little doubt,
his poverty was beyond question, but how
about obedience to his superiors?</p>

<p>The order was shouted up to him in a
Bishop’s voice—he must let down his rope,
draw up a ladder, and descend.</p>

<p>Straightway Simeon made preparation
to obey. And then the Bishops relented
and cried, “We have changed our minds,
and now order you to remain!”</p>

<p>Simeon lifted his hands in adoration and
thankfulness and renewed his lease.</p>

<p>And so he lived on and on and on—he
lived on the top of that pillar, never once
descending for thirty years.</p>

<p>All his former companions grew aweary,
and one by one died, and the monastery
bells tolled their requiem as they were
laid to rest. Did Simeon hear the bells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page34" id="page34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and say, “Soon it will be my turn”?
</p>

<p>Probably not. His senses had flown,
for what good were they! The young
monk who now at eventide brought the
basket with the bottle of goat’s milk
and the loaf of brown bread was born
since Simeon had taken his place on
the pillar.</p>

<p>“He has always been there,” the people
said, and crossed themselves hurriedly.
</p><p>But one evening when the young monk
came with his basket, no line was dropped
down from above. He waited and then
called aloud, but all in vain.</p>

<p>When sunrise came, there sat the monk,
his face between his knees, the folds of
his black robe drawn over his head. But
he did not rise and lift his hands in prayer.
</p><p>All day he sat there, motionless.</p>

<p>The people watched in whispered silence.
Would he arise at sundown and pray,
and with outstretched hands bless the
assembled pilgrims?</p>

<p>And as they watched, a vulture came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page35" id="page35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
sailing slowly through the blue ether,
and circled nearer and nearer; and off
on the horizon was another—and still
another, circling nearer and ever nearer.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>Battle of the Little Big Horn</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was in the Spring
of Eighteen Hundred
Seventy-six that the
Sioux on the Dakota
Reservation became
restless, and after various
fruitless efforts to
restrain them, moved
Westward in a body.
</p><p>This periodic migration was a habit and
a tradition of the tribe. For hundreds of
years they had visited the buffalo country
on an annual hunt.</p>

<p>Now the buffaloes were gone, save for
a few scattered herds in the mountains.
The Indians did not fully realize this,
although they realized that as the Whites
came in, the game went out. The Sioux
were hunters and horsemen by nature.
They traveled and moved about with great
freedom. If restrained or interfered with
they grew irritable and then hostile.</p>

<p>Now they were full of fight. The Whites
had ruined the hunting-grounds; besides
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page40" id="page40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
that, white soldiers had fought them if
they moved to their old haunts, sacred
for their use and bequeathed to them
by their ancestors. In dead of Winter,
when the snows lay deep and they were
in their teepees, crouching around the
scanty fire, soldiers had charged on
horseback through the villages, shooting
into the teepees, killing women and
children.</p>

<p>At the head of these soldiers was a white
chief, whom they called Yellow Hair. He
was a smashing, dashing, fearless soldier
who understood the Indian ways and
haunts, and then used this knowledge
for the undoing of the Red Men.</p>

<p>Yellow Hair wanted to keep them in
one little place all the time, and desired
that they should raise corn like cowardly
Crows, when what they wanted was to
be free and hunt!</p>

<p>They feared Yellow Hair—and hated him.
</p><p>Custer was a man of intelligence—nervous,
energetic, proud. His honesty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page41" id="page41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and sincerity were beyond dispute. He
was a natural Indian fighter. He could
pull his belt one hole tighter and go
three whole days without food. He could
ride like the wind, or crawl in the grass,
and knew how to strike, quickly and
unexpectedly, as the first streak of dawn
came into the East. Like Napoleon, he
knew the value of time, and, in fact, he
had somewhat of the dash and daring,
not to mention the vanity, of the Corsican.
His men believed in him and loved him,
for he marched them to victory, and with
odds of five to one had won again and
again.</p>

<hr />

<p>But Custer had the defect of his qualities;
and to use the Lincoln phrase, sometimes
took counsel of his ambition.</p>

<p>He had fought in the Civil War in places
where no prisoners were taken, and where
there was no commissary. And this wild,
free life had bred in him a habit of unrest—a
chafing at discipline and all rules of
modern warfare.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page42" id="page42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Results were the only things he cared for,
and power was his Deity.</p>

<p>When the Indians grew restless in the
Spring of Seventy-six, Custer was called
to Washington for consultation. President
Grant was not satisfied with our Indian
policy—he thought that in some ways
the Whites were the real savages. The
Indians he considered as children, not
as criminals.</p>

<p>Custer tried to tell him differently. Custer
knew the bloodthirsty character of the
Sioux, their treachery and cunning—he
showed scars by way of proof!</p>

<p>The authorities at Washington needed
Custer. However, his view of the case
did not mean theirs. Custer believed in
the mailed hand, and if given the power
he declared he would settle the Indian
Question in America once and forever.
His confidence and assumption and what
Senator Dawes called swagger were not to
their liking. Anyway, Custer was attracting
altogether too much attention—the people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page43" id="page43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
followed him on Pennsylvania Avenue
whenever he appeared.</p>

<p>General Terry was chosen to head the
expedition against the hostile Sioux, and
Custer was to go as second in command.
</p><p>Terry was older than Custer, but Custer
had seen more service on the plains.
Custer demurred—threatened to resign—and
wrote a note to the President asking
for a personal interview and requesting a
review of the situation.</p>

<p>President Grant refused to see Custer, and
reminded him that the first duty of a
soldier was obedience.</p>

<p>Custer left Washington, glum and sullen—grieved.
But he was a soldier, and so
he reported at Fort Lincoln, as ordered,
to serve under a man who knew less
about Indian fighting than did he.</p>

<p>The force of a thousand men embarked on
six boats at Bismarck. There a banquet
was given in honor of Terry and Custer.
“You will hear from us by courier before
July Fourth,” said Custer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page44" id="page44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
He was still moody and depressed, but
declared his willingness to do his duty.</p>

<p>Terry did not like his attitude and told
him so. Poor Custer was stung by the
reprimand.</p>

<p>He was only a boy, thirty-seven
years old, to be sure, but with the
whimsical, daring, ambitious and jealous
quality of the center-rush. Custer at times
had his eye on the White House—why
not! Had not Grant been a soldier?</p>

<p>Women worshiped Custer, and men who
knew him, never doubted his earnestness
and honesty. He lacked humor.</p>

<p>He was both sincere and serious.</p>

<p>The expedition moved on up the tortuous
Missouri, tying up at night to avoid the
treacherous sandbars that lay in wait.
</p><p>They had reached the Yellowstone
River, and were getting into the Indian
Country.</p>

<p>To lighten the boats, Terry divided his
force into two parts. Custer disembarked
on the morning of the Twenty-fifth of
June, with four hundred forty-three men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page45" id="page45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
besides a dozen who looked after the
pack-train.</p>

<p>Scouts reported that the hostile Sioux
were camped on the Little Big Horn,
seventy-five miles across the country.</p>

<p>Terry gave Custer orders to march the
seventy-five miles in forty-eight hours,
and attack the Indians at the head of
their camp at daylight on the morning
of the Twenty-seventh. There was to be
no parley—panic was the thing desired,
and when Custer had started the savages
on the run, Terry would attack them at
the other end of their village, and the
two fleeing mobs of savages would be
driven on each other, and then they
would cast down their arms and the
trick would be done.</p>

<p>Next, to throw a cordon of soldiers
around the camp and hold it would be
easy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Custer and his men rode away at about
eight o’clock on the morning of the
Twenty-fifth. They were in high spirits,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page46" id="page46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
for the cramped quarters on the transports
made freedom doubly grateful.</p>

<p>They disappeared across the mesa and
through the gray-brown hills, and soon
only a cloud of dust marked their passage.
</p><p>After five miles had been turned off on
a walk, Custer ordered a trot, and then,
where the ground was level, a canter.</p>

<p>On they went.</p>

<p>They pitched camp at four o’clock, having
covered forty miles. The horses were
unsaddled and fed, and supper cooked
and eaten.</p>

<p>But sleep was not to be—these men shall
sleep no more!</p>

<p>The bugles sounded “Boots and Saddles.”
Before sunset they were again on their
way.</p>

<hr />

<p>By three o’clock on the morning of the
Twenty-sixth, they had covered more than
seventy miles.</p>

<p>They halted for coffee.</p>

<p>The night, waiting for the dawn, was
doubly dark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page47" id="page47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Fast-riding scouts had gone on ahead,
and now reported the Indians camped
just over the ridge, four miles away.</p>

<p>Custer divided his force into two parts.
The Indians were camped along the river
for three miles. There were about two
thousand of them, and the women and
children were with them.</p>

<p>Reno with two hundred fifty men was
ordered to swing around and attack the
village from the South. Custer with one
hundred ninety-three men would watch
the charge, and when the valiant Reno had
started the panic and the Indians were
in confusion, his force would then sweep
around and charge them from the other
end of the village.</p>

<p>This was Terry’s plan of battle, only
Custer was going to make the capture
without Terry’s help.</p>

<p>When Terry came up the following day,
he would find the work all done and
neatly, too. Results are the only things
that count, and victory justifies itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page48" id="page48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
</p><p>The battle would go down on the records
as Custer’s triumph!</p>

<p>Reno took a two-mile detour, and just at
peep of day, ere the sun had gilded the
tops of the cottonwoods, charged, with
yells and rapid firing, into the Indian
village. Custer stood on the ridge, his
men mounted and impatient just below
on the other side.</p>

<p>He could distinguish
Reno’s soldiers as they charged into the
underbrush. Their shouts and the sound
of firing filled his fighter’s heart.</p>

<p>The Indians were in confusion—he could
see them by the dim light, stampeding.
They were running in brownish masses
right around the front of the hill where
he stood. He ordered the bugles to blow
the charge.</p>

<p>The soldiers greeted the order with a
yell—tired muscles, the sleepless night,
its seventy-five miles of hard riding,
were forgotten. The battle would be
fought and won in less time than a
man takes to eat his breakfast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page49" id="page49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Down the slope swept Custer’s men
to meet the fleeing foe.</p>

<p>But now the savages had ceased to
flee. They lay in the grass and fired.
</p><p>Several of Custer’s horses fell.</p>

<p>Three of his men threw up their hands,
and dropped from their saddles, limp
like bags of oats, and their horses ran
on alone.</p>

<p>The gully below was full of Indians, and
these sent a murderous fire at Custer as he
came. His horses swerved, but several ran
right on and disappeared, horse and rider
in the sunken ditch, as did Napoleon’s
men at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The mad, headlong charge hesitated. The
cottonwoods, the water and the teepees
were a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Custer glanced back, and a mile distant
saw Reno’s soldiers galloping wildly up
the steep slope of the hill.</p>

<p>Reno’s charge had failed—instead of
riding straight down through the length
of the village and meeting Custer, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page50" id="page50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
had gotten only fifty rods, and then had
been met by a steady fire from Indians
who held their ground. He wedged them
back, but his horses, already overridden,
refused to go on, and the charging troops
were simply carried out of the woods into
the open, and once there they took to the
hills for safety, leaving behind, dead,
one-third of their force.</p>

<p>Custer quickly realized the hopelessness
of charging alone into a mass of Indians,
who were exultant and savage in the
thought of victory. Panic was not for
them.</p>

<hr />

<p>They were armed with Springfield rifles,
while the soldiers had only short-range
carbines.</p>

<p>The bugles now ordered a retreat, and
Custer’s men rode back to the top of
the hill—with intent to join forces with
Reno.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reno was hopelessly cut off. Determined
Sioux filled the gully that separated the
two little bands of brave men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page51" id="page51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Custer, evidently, thought that Reno had
simply withdrawn to re-form his troop,
and that any moment Reno would ride
to his rescue.</p>

<p>Custer decided to hold the hill.</p>

<p>The Indians were shooting at him from
long range, occasionally killing a horse.
</p><p>He told off his fours and ordered the
horses sent to the rear.</p>

<p>The fours led their horses back toward
where they had left their packmules
when they had stopped for coffee at
three o’clock.</p>

<p>But the fours had not gone half a mile
when they were surrounded by a mob
of Indians that just closed in on them.
Every man was killed—the horses were
galloped off by the women and children.
</p><p>Custer now realized that he was caught
in a trap. The ridge where his men lay
face down was half a mile long, and not
more than twenty feet across at the top.
The Indians were everywhere—in the
gullies, in the grass, in little scooped-out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page52" id="page52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
holes. The bullets whizzed above the
heads of Custer’s men as they lay there,
flattening their bodies in the dust.</p>

<p>The morning sun came out, dazzling
and hot.</p>

<p>It was only nine o’clock.</p>

<p>The men were without food and without
water. The Little Big Horn danced over
its rocky bed and shimmered in the golden
light, only half a mile away, and there in
the cool, limpid stream they had been
confident they would now swim and fish,
the battle over, while they proudly held
the disarmed Indians against General
Terry’s coming.</p>

<p>But the fight had not been won, and
death lay between them and water. The
only thing to do was to await Reno or
Terry. Reno might come at any time,
and Terry would arrive without fail at
tomorrow’s dawn—he had said so, and
his word was the word of a soldier.</p>

<p>Custer had blundered.</p>

<p>The fight was lost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page53" id="page53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Now it was just a question of endurance.
Noon came, and the buzzards began to
gather in the azure.</p>

<p>The sun was blistering hot—there was
not a tree, nor a bush, nor a green blade
of grass within reach.</p>

<p>The men had ceased to joke and banter. The situation
was serious. Some tried to smoke, but
their parching thirst was thus only aggravated—they
threw their pipes away.</p>

<p>The Indians now kept up an occasional
shooting.</p>

<p>They were playing with the
soldiers as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>

<p>The Indian is a cautious fighter—he
makes no sacrifices in order to win.
Now he had his prey secure.</p>

<p>Soon the soldiers would run out of
ammunition, and then one more day,
or two at least, and thirst and fatigue
would reduce brave men into old women,
and the squaws could rush in and pound
them on the head with clubs.</p>

<p>The afternoon dragged along its awful
length. Time dwindled and dawdled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page54" id="page54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
At last the sun sank, a ball of fire in
the West.</p>

<p>The moon came out.</p>

<p>Now and then a Sioux would creep up
into shadowy view, but a shot from a
soldier would send him back into hiding.
Down in the cottonwoods the squaws
made campfires and were holding a
dance, singing their songs of victory.
</p><p>Custer warned his men that sleep
was death. This was their second sleepless
night, and the men were feverish with
fatigue. Some babbled in strange tongues,
and talked with sisters and sweethearts
and people who were not there—reason
was tottering.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page55" id="page55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
With Custer was an Indian boy, sixteen
years old, “Curley the Crow.” Custer
now at about midnight told Curley to
strip himself and crawl out among the
Indians, and if possible, get out through
the lines and tell Terry of their position.
Several of Custer’s men had tried to reach
water, but none came back.</p>

<p>Curley got through the lines—his boldness
in mixing with the Indians and his red skin
saving him. He took a long way round
and ran to tell Terry the seriousness of
the situation.</p>

<p>Terry was advancing, but was hampered
and harassed by Indians for twenty miles.
They fired at him from gullies, ridges,
rocks, prairie-dog mounds, and then
retreated. He had to move with caution.
Instead of arriving at daylight as he
expected, Terry was three hours behind.
The Indians surrounding Custer saw the
dust from the advancing troop.</p>

<p>They hesitated to charge Custer boldly
as he lay on the hilltop, entrenched by
little ditches dug in the night with knives,
tin cups and bleeding fingers.</p>

<p>It was easy to destroy Custer, but it
meant a dead Sioux for every white
soldier.</p>

<p>The Indians made sham charges to
draw Custer’s fire, and then withdrew.
</p><p>They circled closer. The squaws came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page56" id="page56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
up with sticks and stones and menaced
wildly.</p>

<p>Custer’s fire grew less and less. He was
running out of ammunition.</p>

<p>Terry was only five miles away.</p>

<p>The Indians closed in like a cloud around
Custer and his few survivors.</p>

<p>It was a hand-to-hand fight—one against
a hundred.</p>

<p>In five minutes every man was dead, and
the squaws were stripping the mangled
and bleeding forms.</p>

<p>Already the main body of Indians was
trailing across the plains toward the
mountains.</p>

<p>Terry arrived, but it was too late.</p>

<p>An hour later Reno limped in, famished,
half of his men dead or wounded, sick,
undone.</p>

<p>To follow the fleeing Indians was useless—the
dead soldiers must be decently
buried, and the living succored. Terry
himself had suffered sore.</p>

<p>The Indians were five thousand strong,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page57" id="page57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
not two. They had gathered up all the
other tribes for more than a hundred miles.
Now they moved North toward Canada.
Terry tried to follow, but they held him
off with a rear-guard, like white veterans.
The Indians escaped across the border.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>Sam</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>In San Francisco lived
a lawyer—age, sixty—rich
in money, rich
in intellect, a business
man with many interests.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, this lawyer was a
bachelor, and lived in
apartments with his
Chinese servant “Sam.”</p>

<p>Sam and his master had been together
for fifteen years.</p>

<p>The servant knew the wants of his
employer as though he were his other
self. No orders were necessary.</p>

<p>If there was to be a company—one
guest or a hundred—Sam was told the
number, that was all, and everything
was provided.</p>

<p>This servant was cook, valet, watchman,
friend.</p>

<p>No stray, unwished-for visitor ever got
to the master to rob him of his rest
when he was at home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page62" id="page62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
If extra help was wanted, Sam secured
it; he bought what was needed; and when
the lawyer awakened in the morning, it
was to the singing of a tiny music-box
with a clock attachment set for seven
o’clock.</p>

<p>The bath was ready; a clean shirt was
there on the dresser, with studs and
buttons in place; collar and scarf were
near; the suit of clothes desired hung
over a chair; the right pair of shoes,
polished like a mirror, was at hand,
and on the mantel was a half-blown
rose, with the dew still upon it, for a
boutonniere.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the breakfast,
hot and savory, waited.</p>

<p>When the good man was ready to go
to the office, silent as a shadow stood
Sam in the hallway, with overcoat, hat
and cane in hand.</p>

<p>When the weather was threatening, an
umbrella was substituted for the cane.
The door was opened, and the master
departed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page63" id="page63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
When he returned at nightfall, on his
approach the door swung wide.</p>

<p>Sam never took a vacation; he seemed
not to either eat or sleep.</p>

<p>He was always near when needed; he
disappeared when he should.</p>

<p>He knew nothing and he knew everything.</p>

<p>For weeks scarcely a word might pass
between these men, they understood each
other so well.</p>

<p>The lawyer grew to have a great affection
for his servant.</p>

<p>He paid him a hundred dollars a month,
and tried to devise other ways to show
his gratitude; but Sam wanted nothing,
not even thanks.</p>

<p>All he desired was the privilege to serve.</p>

<p>But one morning as Sam poured his
master’s coffee, he said quietly, without
a shade of emotion on his yellow face,
“Next week I leave you.”</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page64" id="page64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
“Next week I leave you,” repeated the
Chinese; “I hire for you better man.”</p>

<p>The lawyer set down his cup of coffee.
He looked at the white-robed servant.
He felt the man was in earnest.</p>

<p>“So you are going to leave me—I do
not pay you enough, eh? That Doctor
Sanders who was here—he knows what
a treasure you are. Don’t be a fool, Sam;
I’ll make it a hundred and fifty a month—say
no more.”</p>

<p>“Next week I leave you—I go to China,”
said the servant impassively.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! You are going back for a
wife? All right, bring her here—you will
return in two months? I do not object;
bring your wife here—there is work for
two to keep this place in order. The place
is lonely, anyway. I’ll see the Collector
of the Port, myself, and arrange your
passage-papers.”</p>

<p>“I go to China next week: I need no papers—I
never come back,” said the man with
exasperating calmness and persistence.</p>

<p>"By God, you shall not go!" said the
lawyer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page65" id="page65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
“By God, I will!” answered the heathen.
</p><p>It was the first time in their experience
together that the servant had used such
language, or such a tone, toward his
master.</p>

<p>The lawyer pushed his chair back, and
after an instant said, quietly, “Sam, you
must forgive me; I spoke quickly. I do
not own you—but tell me, what have
I done—why do you leave me this way,
you know I need you!”</p>

<p>“I will not tell you why I go—you laugh.”
</p>

<p>“No, I shall not laugh.”</p>

<p>“You will.”</p>

<p>“I say, I will not.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I go to China to die!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You can die here. Haven’t
I agreed to send your body back if you
die before I do?”</p>

<p>“I die in four weeks, two days!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“My brother, he in prison. He twenty-six,
I fifty. He have wife and baby. In China
they accept any man same family to die.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page66" id="page66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
I go to China, give my money to my
brother—he live, I die!”</p>

<p>The next day a new Chinaman appeared
as servant in the lawyer’s household. In
a week this servant knew everything, and
nothing, just like Sam.</p>

<p>And Sam disappeared, without saying
good-by.</p>

<p>He went to China and was beheaded,
four weeks and two days from the day
he broke the news of his intent to go.
</p><p>His brother was set free.</p>

<p>And the lawyer’s household goes along
about as usual, save when the master
calls for “Sam,” when he should say,
“Charlie.”</p>

<p>At such times there comes a kind of
clutch at his heart, but he says nothing.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>Cleopatra and Cæsar</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>The sole surviving
daughter of the great
King Ptolemy of Egypt,
Cleopatra was seventeen
years old when her
father died.</p>

<p>By his will the King
made her joint heir to
the throne with her
brother Ptolemy, several years her junior.
And according to the custom not unusual
among royalty at that time, it was provided
that Ptolemy should become the
husband of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>She was a woman—her brother a child.
</p><p>She had intellect, ambition, talent. She
knew the history of her own country, and
that of Assyria, Greece and Rome; and
all the written languages of the world
were to her familiar. She had been
educated by the philosophers, who had
brought from Greece the science of
Pythagoras and Plato. Her companions
had been men—not women, or nurses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page70" id="page70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
or pious, pedantic priests.</p>

<p>Through the
veins of her young body pulsed and
leaped life, plus.</p>

<p>She abhorred the thought of an alliance
with her weak-chinned brother; and the
ministers of State, who suggested another
husband as a compromise, were dismissed
with a look.</p>

<p>They said she was intractable, contemptuous,
unreasonable, and was scheming
for the sole possession of the throne.</p>

<p>She was not to be diverted even by
ardent courtiers who were sent to her,
and who lay in wait ready with amorous
sighs—she scorned them all.</p>

<p>Yet she was a woman still, and in her
dreams she saw the coming prince.</p>

<p>She was banished from Alexandria.</p>

<p>A few friends followed her, and an army
was formed to force from the enemy her
rights.</p>

<p>But other things were happening—a
Roman army came leisurely drifting in
with the tide and disembarked at Alexandria.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page71" id="page71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
The Great Cæsar himself was in
command—a mere holiday, he said. He
had intended to join the land forces of
Mark Antony and help crush the rebellious
Pompey, but Antony had done the trick
alone; and only a few days before, word
had come that Pompey was dead.</p>

<p>Cæsar knew that civil war was on in
Alexandria, and being near he sailed
slowly in, sending messengers on ahead
warning both sides to lay down their arms.
</p><p>With him was the far-famed invincible
Tenth Legion that had ravished Gaul.
Cæsar wanted to rest his men and,
incidentally, to reward them. They took
possession of the city without a blow.
</p>

<p>Cleopatra’s troops laid down their arms,
but Ptolemy’s refused. They were simply
chased beyond the walls, and their punishment
for the time being was deferred.</p>

<p>Cæsar took possession of the palace of
the King, and his soldiers accommodated
themselves in the houses, public buildings,
and temples as best they could.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page72" id="page72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Cleopatra asked for a personal interview,
in order to present her cause.</p>

<p>Cæsar declined to meet her—he understood
the trouble—many such cases he had
seen. Claimants for thrones were not new
to him. Where two parties quarreled, both
are right—or wrong—it really mattered
little.</p>

<p>It is absurd to quarrel—still more foolish
to fight.</p>

<p>Cæsar was a man of peace, and to keep
the peace he would appoint one of his
generals governor, and make Egypt a
Roman colony.</p>

<p>In the meantime he would rest a week
or two, with the kind permission of
the Alexandrians, and write upon his
“Commentaries”—no, he would not see
either Cleopatra or Ptolemy—any desired
information they would get through his
trusted emissaries.</p>

<p>In the service of Cleopatra was a Sicilian
slave who had been her personal servant
since she was a little girl. This man’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page73" id="page73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
name was Appolidorus. He was a man of
giant stature and imposing mien. Ten
years before his tongue had been torn
out as a token that as he was to attend
a queen he should tell no secrets.</p>

<p>Appolidorus had but one thought in life,
and that was to defend his gracious queen.
He slept at the door of Cleopatra’s tent,
a naked sword at his side, held in his
clenched and brawny hand.</p>

<p>And now behold at dusk of day the grim
and silent Appolidorus, carrying upon his
giant shoulders a large and curious rug,
rolled up and tied ’round at each end with
ropes.</p>

<p>He approaches the palace of the
King, and at the guarded gate hands a note
to the officer in charge. This note gives
information to the effect that a certain
patrician citizen of Alexandria, being
glad that the gracious Cæsar had deigned
to visit Egypt, sends him the richest rug
that can be woven—done, in fact, by his
wife and daughters and held against this
day, awaiting Rome’s greatest son.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page74" id="page74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
The officer reads the note, and orders a
soldier to accept the gift and carry it
within—presents were constantly arriving.
A sign from the dumb giant makes the
soldier stand back—the present is for
Cæsar and can be delivered only in
person. “Lead and I will follow,” were
the words done in stern pantomime.
The officer laughs, sends in the note, and
the messenger soon returning, signifies
that the present is acceptable and the
slave bearing it shall be shown in.
Appolidorus shifts his burden to the
other shoulder, and follows the soldier
through the gate, up the marble steps,
along the splendid hallway, lighted by
flaring torches and lined with reclining
Roman soldiers.</p>

<p>At a door they pause an instant, there
is a whispered word—they enter.</p>

<p>The room is furnished as becomes the
room that is the private library of the
King of Egypt. In one corner, seated
at the table, pen in hand, sits a man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page75" id="page75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of middle age, pale, clean-shaven, with
hair close-cropped. His dress is not that
of a soldier—it is the flowing white robe
of a Roman Priest. Only one servant
attends this man, a secretary, seated near,
who rises and explains that the present
is acceptable and shall be deposited on
the floor.</p>

<p>The pale man at the table looks up,
smiles a tired smile and murmurs in a
perfunctory way his thanks.</p>

<p>Appolidorus having laid his burden on
the floor, kneels to untie the ropes.
The secretary explains that he need not
trouble, pray bear thanks and again
thanks to his master—he need not tarry!
</p><p>The dumb man on his knees neither
hears nor heeds. The rug is unrolled.
</p><p>From out the roll a woman leaps
lightly to her feet—a beautiful young
woman of twenty.</p>

<p>She stands there, poised, defiant, gazing
at the pale-faced man seated at the table.
</p><p>He is not surprised—he never was.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page76" id="page76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
One might have supposed he received
all his visitors in this manner.</p>

<p>“Well?” he says in a quiet way, a half-smile
parting his thin lips.</p>

<p>The breast of the woman heaves with
tumultuous emotion—just an instant. She
speaks, and there is no tremor in her
tones. Her voice is low, smooth and
scarcely audible: “I am Cleopatra.”</p>

<p>The man at the desk lays down his pen,
leans back and gently nods his head,
as much as to say, indulgently, “Yes,
my child, I hear—go on!”</p>

<p>“I am Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and
I would speak with thee, alone.”</p>

<p>She pauses; then raising one jeweled
arm motions to Appolidorus that he
shall withdraw.</p>

<p>With a similar motion, the man at the
desk signifies the same to his astonished
secretary.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p>Appolidorus went down the long hallway,
down the stone steps and waited at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page77" id="page77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
outer gate amid the throng of soldiers.
They questioned him, gibed him, railed
at him, but they got no word in reply.
</p><p>He waited—he waited an hour, two—and
then came a messenger with a note
written on a slip of parchment. The
words ran thus: “Well-beloved ’Dorus:
Veni, vidi, vici! Go fetch my maids;
also, all of our personal belongings.”</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>A Special Occasion</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>Once on a day, I spoke
at the Athenæum, New
Orleans, for the Young
Men’s Hebrew Association.</p>

<p>When they had asked
my fee I answered,
“One Hundred Fifty
Dollars.” The reply
was, “We will pay you Two Hundred—it
is to be a special occasion.”</p>

<p>A carriage was sent to my hotel for me.
The Jews may be close traders, but when
it comes to social functions, they know
what to do. The Jew is the most generous
man in the world, even if he can be at
times cent per cent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page82" id="page82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
As I approached the Athenæum I thought,
“What a beautiful building!” It was stone
and brick—solid, subdued, complete and
substantial. The lower rooms were used
for the Hebrew Club. Upstairs stretched
the splendid hall, as I could tell from the
brilliantly lighted windows.</p>


<p>Inside, I noticed that the stairways were
carpeted with Brussels. Glancing through
the wide doorways, I beheld an audience
of more than two thousand people. The
great chandeliers sent out a dazzling glory
from their crystal and gold. At the sides,
rich tapestries and hangings of velvet
covered the windows.</p>

<p>“A beautiful building,” I said to my
old-time friend, Maurice J. Pass, the
Secretary of the Club.</p>

<p>He smiled in satisfaction and replied,
“Well, we seldom let things go by default—you
have tonight as fine an audience as
ever assembled in New Orleans.”</p>

<p>We passed down a side hallway and under
the stage, preparatory to going on the
platform. In this room below the stage a
single electric light shone. The place was
dark and dingy, in singular contrast to
the beauty, light, cleanliness and order
just beyond. In the corner were tables
piled high—evidently used for banquets—broken
furniture and discarded boxes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page83" id="page83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
</p><p>Several smart young men in full dress
sat on the tables smoking cigarettes. One
young man said in explanation, “We
were crowded out—had to give up our
seats to ladies—so we are going to sit on
the stage.”</p>

<p>The soft blue smoke from the cigarettes
seemed to hug close about the lonely
electric light.</p>

<p>I saw the smoke and thought that beside
the odor of tobacco I detected the smell
of smoldering pine.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a trifle smoky here?” I said
to the young man nearest me.</p>

<p>He laughed at this remark and handed
me a cigarette.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Club and I went
up the narrow stairs to the stage. As
we stood there behind the curtain I
looked at the pleasant-faced man. “You
didn’t detect the odor of burning wood
down there, did you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No; but you see the windows are open,
and there are bonfires outside, I suppose.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page84" id="page84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
</p><p>“I am a fool,” I thought; “and James
Whitcomb Riley was right when he said
that the speaker who is about to make
his bow to an audience is always so
keyed up that at the moment he is
incapable of sane thinking.”</p>

<p>I excused myself and walked over to
an open window at the back of the
stage and looked down.</p>

<p>It must have been forty feet to the stony
street beneath.</p>

<p>Then I went to a side window and
threw up the sash. This window looked
out on a roof ten or twelve feet below.
I got a broken broom that stood in the
corner and propped the window open.
</p><p>The thought of fire was upon me and
I was inwardly planning what I would
do in case of a stampede. I am always
thinking about what I would do should
this or that happen. Nothing can surprise
me—not even death. If any of my best
helpers should leave me, I have it all
planned exactly whom I will put in their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page85" id="page85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
places. I have it arranged who will take
my own place—my will is made and
my body is to be cremated.</p>

<p>“Cremated? Not tonight!” I said to
myself, as I placed the broom under
the sash. “If a panic occurs, the people
will go out of the doors and I will stick
to the stage until my coat-tails singe.
I’ll say that the fire is in an adjoining
building; then I’ll smilingly bow myself
off the stage and gently drop out of that
window.”</p>

<p>“All ready when you are,” said Mr. Fass.
</p><p>I passed out on the stage before that
vast sea of faces.</p>

<p>It was a glorious sight. There was a row
of military men from the French warship
in the harbor, down in front; priests, and
ladies with sparkling diamonds; a bishop
wearing a purple vestment under his black
gown sat to one side; a stout lady in
decollete waved a feather fan in rhythmic,
mystic motion, far back to the left.</p>

<p>The audience applauded encouragingly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page86" id="page86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
I wished I was back in that dear East
Aurora. But I began.</p>

<p>In a few minutes my heart ceased to
thump and I knew we were off.</p>

<p>I spoke for two hours, and I spoke well.
</p><p>I did not push the lecture in front of
me, nor did I drag it behind. I got the
chancery twist on it and carried it off
big, as I do about one time in ten. I
finished in a whirlwind of applause, with
the bishop crying “Bravo!” and the fat
lady with the fifty-dollar feather fan
beaming approbation.</p>

<p>Fass stood in the wings to congratulate
me.</p>

<hr />

<p>I shook hands with a hundred. The house
slowly emptied. I bade the genial Fass
good-by. He took my hand in both of
his. “You will come back! You must come
back!” he said.</p>

<p>He walked with me, bareheaded, to my
carriage.</p>

<p>He again pressed my hand.</p>

<p>I rode to my hotel and went to bed,
and to sleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page87" id="page87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
I was awakened by a bright glare of light
that filled my room.</p>

<p>I got up and looked
at my watch. It was just midnight.</p>

<p>Off to the East I saw red tongues of angry
flame streaking the sky from horizon to
zenith.</p>

<p>“It is the Jewish Club, all right,” I said.
</p>

<p>I pulled down the blind and went back
to bed.</p>

<p>When I went down to breakfast at
seven o’clock in the morning, I heard
the newsboys in the streets crying, “All
about the fire!” I bought a paper and
read the headline, “Hubbard’s Lecture
Hot Stuff!”</p>

<p>I walked out Saint Charles Avenue and
viewed the smoldering ruins where only a
few hours before I had spoken to more than
two thousand people—where the bishop
in purple vestment had cried “Bravo!”
and the stout lady with feathered fan
had beamed approval.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page88" id="page88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
“Was anybody hurt?” I asked one of
the policemen on guard.</p>

<p>“Only one man killed—Fass, the Secretary;
I believe he lies somewhere over there
to the left, beneath that toppled wall.”</p>

<p>The opinion prevails all
through the truly rural
districts that the big
cities are for the most
part given over to Confidence
Men.</p>

<p>And the strange part
is that the opinion is
correct.</p>

<p>But it should not be assumed that all the
people in, say, Buffalo, are moral derelicts—there
are many visitors there, most of
the time, from other sections.</p>

<p>And while at all times one should exercise
caution, yet to assume that the party who
is “fresh” is intent on high crimes and
misdemeanors may be a rather hasty and
unjust generalization.</p>

<p>For instance, there are Uncle Joe and
Aunt Melinda, who live eight miles back
from East Aurora, at Wales Hollow. They
had been married for forty-seven years,
and had never taken a wedding-journey.
They decided to go to Buffalo and spend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page92" id="page92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
two days at a hotel regardless of expense.
</p><p>Much had been told them about the
Confidence Men who hang around the
railroad-station, and they were prepared.
</p><p>They arrived at East Aurora, where
they were to take the train, an hour ahead
of time. The Jerkwater came in and
they were duly seated, when all at once
Uncle Joe rushed for the door, jumped
off and made for the waiting-room looking
for his carpetbag. It was on the train all
right, but he just forgot, and feeling sure
he had left it in the station made the
grand skirmish as aforesaid.</p>

<p>The result was that the train went off
and left your Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p>Aunt Melinda was much exercised, but
the train-hands pacified her by assurances
that her husband would follow on the next
train, and she should simply wait for him
in the depot at Buffalo.</p>

<p>Now the Flyer was right behind the Jerkwater,
and Uncle Joe took the Flyer and
got to Buffalo first. When the Jerkwater
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page93" id="page93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
came in, Uncle Joe was on the platform
waiting for Aunt Melinda.</p>

<p>As she disembarked he approached her.</p>

<p>She shied and passed on.</p>

<p>He persisted in his attentions.</p>

<p>Then it was that she shook her umbrella
at him and bade him hike. The eternally
feminine in her nature prompted self-preservation.
She banked on her reason—woman’s
reason—not her intuition. She
had started first—her husband could only
come on a later train.</p>

<p>“Go ’way and leave me alone,” she
shouted in shrill falsetto. “You have got
yourself up to look like my Joe—and
that idiotic grin on your homely face is
just like my Joe, but no city sharper can
fool me, and if you don’t go right along
I’ll call for the perlice!”</p>

<p>She called for the police, and Uncle Joe
had to show a strawberry-mark to prove
his identity, before he received recognition.</p>

<p>One day last Winter in
New York I attended
a police court on a
side street, just off
lower Broadway. I was
waiting to see my old
friend Rosenfeld in the
Equitable Life Building,
but as his office
didn’t open up until nine o’clock, I put
in my time at the police court.</p>

<p>There was the usual assortment of drunks,
petty thieves—male and female, black,
white and coffee-colored—disorderlies,
vagabonds and a man in full-dress suit
and a wide expanse of dull ecru shirt-bosom.</p>

<p>The place was stuffy, foul-smelling, and
reeked with a stale combination of tobacco
and beer and patchouli, and tears, curses,
fear and promises unkept.</p>

<p>The Judge turned things off, but without
haste. He showed more patience and
consideration than one usually sees on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page98" id="page98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the bench. His judgments seemed to be
gentle and just.</p>

<p>The courtroom was clearing, and I started
to go.</p>

<hr />

<p>As I was passing down the icy steps a
piping child’s voice called to me, “Mister,
please give me a lift!”</p>

<p>There at the foot of the steps, standing
in the snow, was a slender slip of a girl,
yellow and earnest, say ten years old,
with a shawl pinned over her head. She
held in her hand a rope, and this rope
was tied to a hand-sled. On this sled
sat a little boy, shivering, dumpy and
depressed, his bare red hands clutching
the seat.</p>

<p>“Mister, I say, please give me a lift!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” I said.</p>

<p>It was a funny sight.</p>

<p>This girl seemed absolutely unconscious
of herself. She was not at all abashed, and
very much in earnest about something.</p>

<p>Evidently she had watched the people
coming out and had waited until one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page99" id="page99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
appeared that she thought safe to call
on for help.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll give you a lift—what is
it you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go inside and see the Judge.
It’s about my brudder here. He is six,
goin’ on seven, and they sent him home
from school ’cause they said he wasn’t
old enough. I’m going to have that teacher
’rested. I’ve got the Bible here that says
he’s six years old. If you’ll carry the book
I’ll bring Billy and the sled!”</p>

<p>“Where is the Bible?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Billy’s settin’ on it.”</p>

<p>It was a big,
black, greasy Family Bible, evidently a
relic of better days. It had probably been
hidden under the bed for safety.</p>

<p>The girl grappled the sled with one hand,
and with the other Billy’s little red fist.</p>

<p>I followed, carrying the big, black, greasy
Family Bible.</p>

<p>Evidently this girl had been here before.
She walked around the end of the judicial
bar, and laid down the sled. Then she took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page100" id="page100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the Bible out of my hands. It was about
all she could do to lift it.</p>

<p>In a shrill, piping voice, full of business,
and very much in earnest, she addressed
the Judge: “I say, Mister Judge, they
sent my brudder Billy away from school,
they did. He’s six, goin’ on seven, and I
want that teacher ’rested and brought here
so you can tell her to let Billy go to school.
Here is our Family Bible—you can see for
yourself how old Billy is!”</p>

<p>The Judge adjusted his glasses, stared,
and exclaimed, “God bless my soul!”</p>

<p>Then he called a big, blue-coated officer
over and said: “Mike, you go with this
little girl and her brother, and tell that
teacher, if possible, to allow the boy to
go to school; that I say he is old enough.
You understand! If you do not succeed,
come back and tell me why.”</p>

<p>The officer smiled and saluted.</p>

<p>The big policeman took the little boy in
his arms. The girl carried the sled, and
I followed with the Family Bible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page101" id="page101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The officer looked at me—“Newspaper
man, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“What paper?”</p>

<p>“The American.”</p>

<p>“It’s the best ever.”</p>

<p>“I think so—possibly with a few exceptions.”</p>

<p>“She’s the queerest lot yet, is this kid,”
and the big bluecoat jerked his thumb
toward the girl.</p><p>I suggested that we go
to the restaurant across the way and get
a bite of something to eat.</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry,” said the officer, “but
the youngsters look as if they hadn’t et
since day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>We lined up at the counter.</p>

<p>The officer drank two cups of coffee and
ate a ham sandwich, two hard-boiled eggs,
a plate of cakes and a piece of pie.</p>

<p>The girl and her brother each had a plate
of cakes, a piece of pie and a glass of milk.</p>

<p>“What’s yours?” asked the waiter.</p>

<p>“Same,” said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page102" id="page102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
As I did not care for the cakes, the officer
cleaned the plate for me.</p>

<p>I didn’t have time to go to the school,
but the officer assured me that he would
“fix it,” and he winked knowingly, as if
he had looked after such things before.
He was kind, but determined, and I had
confidence he would see that the little
boy was duly admitted.</p>

<p>I started up the street alone.</p>

<p>They went the other way. The officer
carried the little boy.</p>

<p>The girl with the shawl over her head
followed, pulling the hand-sled, and on the
sled rested the big, black Family Bible. I
lost sight of them as they turned the corner.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>John the Baptist and Salome</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>John the Baptist, the
strong, fine youth, came
up out of the wilderness
crying in the streets
of Jerusalem, “Repent
ye! Repent ye!”</p>

<p>Salome heard the call
and from her window
looked with half-closed,
catlike eyes upon the semi-naked, young
fanatic.</p>

<p>She smiled, did this idle creature of
luxury, as she lay there amid the cushions
on her couch, and gazed through the
casement upon the preacher in the street.
</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to her.</p>

<p>She arose on her elbow—she called her slaves.</p>

<p>They clothed her in a gaudy gown,
dressed her hair, and led her forth.</p>

<p>Salome followed the wild, weird, religious
enthusiast.</p>

<p>She pushed through the crowd and placed
herself near the man, so the smell of her
body would reach his nostrils.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page106" id="page106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
His eyes ranged the swelling lines of her
body.</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>She half-smiled and gave him that look
which had snared the soul of many
another.</p>

<p>But he only gazed at her with passionless,
judging intensity and repeated his cry,
“Repent ye. Repent ye, for the day is
at hand!”</p>

<p>Her reply, uttered soft and low, was
this: “I would kiss thy lips!”</p>

<p>He moved away and she reached to
seize his garment, repeating, “I would
kiss thy lips—I would kiss thy lips!”</p>

<p>He turned aside, and forgot her, as
he continued his warning cry, and went
his way.</p>

<p>The next day she waylaid the youth
again; as he came near she suddenly
and softly stepped forth and said in
that same low, purring voice, “I would
kiss thy lips!”</p>

<p>He repulsed her with scorn.</p>

<p>She threw her arms about him and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page107" id="page107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
sought to draw his head down near hers.
</p><p>He pushed her from him with sinewy
hands, sprang as from a pestilence, and
was lost in the pressing throng.</p>

<p>That night she danced before Herod
Antipas, and when the promise was
recalled that she should have anything
she wished, she named the head of the
only man who had ever turned away
from her. “The head of John the Baptist
on a charger!”</p>

<p>In an hour the wish was gratified.</p>

<p>Two eunuchs stood before Salome with
a silver tray bearing its fearsome burden.
</p><p>The woman smiled—a smile of triumph,
as she stepped forth with tinkling feet.</p>

<p>A look of pride came over the painted face.
</p><p>Her jeweled fingers reached into the
blood-matted hair. She lifted the head
aloft, and the bracelets on her brown,
bare arms fell to her shoulders, making
strange music. Her face pressed the face
of the dead.</p>

<p>In exultation she exclaimed,
“I have kissed thy lips!”</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>The Master</h2>
  <p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>Giovanni Bellini was his name.</p>

<p>Yet when people who loved
beautiful pictures spoke
of “Gian,” every one
knew who was meant;
but to those who worked
at art he was “The
Master.” He was two
inches under six feet in height, strong
and muscular. In spite of his seventy
summers his carriage was erect, and
there was a jaunty suppleness about his
gait that made him seem much younger.
In fact, no one would have believed
he had lived over his threescore and
ten, were it not for the iron-gray hair
that fluffed out all around under the
close-fitting black cap, and the bronzed
complexion—sun-kissed by wind and by
weather—which formed a trinity of opposites
that made people turn and stare.
</p><p>Queer stories used to be told about
him. He was a skilful gondolier, and it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page112" id="page112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was the daily row back and forth from
the Lido that gave him that face of
bronze. Folks said he ate no meat and
drank no wine, and that his food was
simply ripe figs in the season, with coarse
rye bread and nuts.</p>

<p>Then there was that funny old hunchback,
a hundred years old at least, and
stone-deaf, who took care of the gondola,
spending the whole day, waiting for his
master, washing the trim, graceful, blue-black
boat, arranging the awning with the
white cords and tassels, and polishing the
little brass lions at the sides. People tried
to question the old hunchback, but he
gave no secrets away. The master always
stood up behind and rowed; while down
on the cushions rode the hunchback, the
guest of honor.</p>

<p>There stood the master erect, plying
the oar, his long black robe tucked up
under the dark blue sash that exactly
matched the color of the gondola. The
man’s motto might have been, “Ich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page113" id="page113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Dien,” or that passage of Scripture,
“He that is greatest among you shall
be your servant.” Suspended around his
neck by a slender chain was a bronze
medal, presented by vote of the Signoria
when the great picture of “The Transfiguration”
was unveiled. If this medal
had been a crucifix, and you had met
the wearer in San Marco, one glance
at the finely chiseled features, the black
cap and the flowing robe and you would
have said at once the man was a priest,
Vicar-General of some important diocese.
But seeing him standing erect on the stern
of a gondola, the wind caressing the dark
gray hair, you would have been perplexed
until your gondolier explained in serious
undertone that you had just passed “the
greatest Painter in all Venice, Gian, the
Master.”</p>

<p>Then, if you showed curiosity and wanted
to know further, the gondolier would have
told you more about this strange man.
</p><p>The canals of Venice are the highways,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page114" id="page114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and the gondoliers are like ’bus-drivers
in Piccadilly—they know everybody and
are in close touch with all the Secrets of
State. When you get to the Gindecca and
tie up for lunch, over a bottle of Chianti,
your gondolier will tell you this:</p>

<p>The hunchback there in the gondola,
rowed by the Master, is the Devil, who
has taken that form just to be with and
guard the greatest artist the world has
ever seen. Yes, Signor, that clean-faced
man with his frank, wide-open, brown
eyes is in league with the Evil One. He
is the man who took young Tiziano from
Cadore into his shop, right out of a glass-factory,
and made him a great artist,
getting him commissions and introducing
him everywhere! And how about the
divine Giorgione who called him father?
Oho!</p>

<p>And who is Giorgione? The son of some
unknown peasant woman. And if Bellini
wanted to adopt him, treat him as his
son indeed, kissing him on the cheek
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page115" id="page115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
when he came back just from a day’s
visit to Mestre, whose business was it!
Oho!</p>

<p>Beside that, his name isn’t Giorgione—it
is Giorgio Barbarelli. And didn’t
this Giorgio Barbarelli, and Tiziano from
Cadore, and Espero Carbonne, and that
Gustavo from Nuremberg, and the others
paint most of Gian’s pictures? Surely they
did. The old man simply washes in the
backgrounds and the boys do the work.
About all old Gian does is to sign the
picture, sell it and pocket the proceeds.
Carpaccio helps him, too—Carpaccio who
painted the loveliest little angel sitting
cross-legged playing the biggest mandolin
you ever saw in your life.</p>

<p>That is genius, you know, the ability to
get some one else to do the work, and
then capture the ducats and the honors
for yourself. Of course, Gian knows how
to lure the boys on—something has to be
done in order to hold them. Gian buys a
picture from them now and then; his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page116" id="page116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
studio is full of their work—better than
he can do. Oh, he knows a good thing
when he sees it. These pictures will be
valuable some day, and he gets them at
his own price. It was Antonello of Messina
who introduced oil-painting into Venice.
Before that they mixed their paints
with water, milk or wine. But when
Antonello came along with his dark,
lustrous pictures, he set all artistic Venice
astir. Gian Bellini discovered the secret,
they say, by feigning to be a gentleman
and going to the newcomer and sitting
for his picture. He it was who discovered
that Antonello mixed his colors with oil.
Oho!</p>

<p>Of course, not all of the pictures in
his studio are painted by the boys:
some are painted by that old Dutchman
what’s-his-name—oh, yes, Durer, Alberto
Durer of Nuremberg. Two Nuremberg
painters were in that very gondola last
week just where you sit—they are here
in Venice now, taking lessons from Gian,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page117" id="page117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
they said. Gian was up there to Nuremberg
and lived a month with Durer—they
worked together, drank beer together, I
suppose, and caroused. Gian is very strict
about what he does in Venice, but you
can never tell what a man will do when
he is away from home. The Germans
are a roystering lot—but they do say
they can paint. Me? I have never been
up there—and do not want to go, either—there
are no canals there. To be sure,
they print books in Nuremberg. It was
up there somewhere that they invented
type, a lazy scheme to do away with
writing. They are a thrifty lot—those
Germans—they give me my fare and a
penny more, just a single penny, and
no matter how much I have talked and
pointed out the wonderful sights, and
imparted useful information, known to
me alone—only one penny extra—think
of it!</p>

<p>Yes, printing was first done at Mayence
by a German, Gutenberg, about sixty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page118" id="page118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
years ago. One of Gutenberg’s workmen
went up to Nuremberg and taught others
how to design and cast type. This man,
Alberto Durer, helped them, designing
the initials and making their title-pages
by cutting the design on a wood block,
then covering this block with ink, laying
a sheet of paper upon it, placing it in
a press, and then when the paper is
lifted off it looks exactly like the original
drawing. In fact, most people couldn’t
tell the difference, and here you can
print thousands of them from the one
block.</p>

<p>Bellini makes drawings for title-pages and
initials for Aldus and Nicholas Jenson.
Venice is the greatest printing place in
the world, and yet the business began
here only thirty years ago. The first book
printed here was in Fourteen Hundred
Sixty-nine, by John of Speyer. There
are two hundred licensed printing-presses
here, and it takes usually four men to
a press—two to set the type and get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page119" id="page119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
things ready, and two to run the press.
This does not count, of course, the men
who write the books, and those who
make the type and cut the blocks from
which they print the pictures for the
illustrations. At first, you know, the books
they printed in Venice had no title-pages,
initials or illustrations. My father was
a printer and he remembers when the
first large initials were printed—before
that the spaces were left blank and the
books were sent out to the monasteries
to be completed by hand.</p>

<p>Gian and Gentile had a good deal to
do about cutting the first blocks for
initials—they got the idea, I think, from
Nuremberg. And now there are Dutchmen
down here from Amsterdam learning how
to print books and paint pictures. Several
of them are in Gian’s studio, I hear—every
once in a while I get them for a
trip to the Lido or to Murano.</p>

<p>Gentile Bellini is his brother and looks
very much like him. The Grand Turk
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page120" id="page120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
at Constantinople came here once and
saw Gian Bellini at work in the Great
Hall. He had never seen a good picture
before and was amazed. He wanted the
Senate to sell Gian to him, thinking he
was a slave. They humored the Pagan
by hiring Gentile Bellini to go instead,
loaning him out for two years, so to speak.
</p><p>Gentile went, and the Sultan, who
never allowed any one to stand before
him, all having to grovel in the dirt,
treated Gentile as an equal. Gentile
even taught the old rogue to draw a
little, and they say the painter had a
key to every room in the palace, and
was treated like a prince.</p>

<p>Well, they got along all right, until
one day Gentile drew the picture of
the head of John the Baptist on a charger.
</p><p>“A man’s head doesn’t look like that
when it is cut off,” said the Grand Turk
contemptuously. Gentile had forgotten
that the Turk was on familiar ground.
</p><p>“Perhaps the Light of the Sun knows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page121" id="page121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
more about painting than I do!” said
Gentile, as he kept right on at his work.
</p><p>“I may not know much about painting,
but I’m no fool in some other things I
might name,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The Sultan clapped his hands three
times: two slaves appeared from opposite
doors. One was a little ahead of the other,
and as this one approached, the Sultan
with a single swing of the snickersnee
snipped off his head. This teaches us
that obedience to our superiors is its
own reward. But the lesson was wholly
lost on Gentile Bellini, for he did not
even remain to examine the severed head
for art’s sake. The thought that it might
be his turn next was supreme, and he
leaped through a window, taking the
sash with him. Making his way to the
docks he found a sailing vessel loading
with fruit, bound for Venice. A small
purse of gold made the matter easy:
the captain of the boat secreted him,
and in four days he was safely back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page122" id="page122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in Saint Mark’s giving thanks to God
for his deliverance.</p>

<p>No, I didn’t say Gian was a rogue—I
only told you what others say. I am
only a poor gondolier—why should I
trouble myself about what great folks
do? I simply tell you what I hear—it
may be so, and it may not. God knows!
There is that Pascale Salvini—he has a
rival studio—and when that Genoese,
Christoforo Colombo, was here and made
his stopping-place at Bellini’s studio,
Pascale told every one that Colombo was
a lunatic, and Bellini another, for encouraging
him to show his foolish maps and
charts. Now, they do say that Colombo has
discovered a new world, and Italians are
feeling troubled in conscience because they
did not fit him out with ships instead of
forcing him to go to Spain.</p>

<p>No, I didn’t say Bellini was a hypocrite—Pascale’s
pupils say so, and once they
followed him over to Murano—three
barca-loads and my gondola beside.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page123" id="page123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
You see it was like this: Twice a week
just after sundown, we used to see Gian
Bellini untie his boat from the landing
there behind the Doge’s palace, turn the
prow, and beat out for Murano, with no
companion but that deaf old caretaker.
Twice a week, Tuesdays and Fridays—always
at just the same hour, regardless
of the weather—we would see the old
hunchback light the lamps, and in a few
moments the Master would appear, tuck
up his black robe, step into the boat, take
the oar and away they would go. It was
always to Murano, and always to the
same landing—one of our gondoliers had
followed them several times, just out of
curiosity.</p>

<p>Finally it came to the ears of Pascale that
Gian took this regular trip to Murano.
“It is a rendezvous,” said Pascale. “It
is worse than that: an orgy among those
lacemakers and the rogues of the glassworks.
Oh, to think that Gian should
stoop to such things at his age—his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page124" id="page124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
pretended asceticism is but a mask—and
at his age!”</p>

<p>The Pascale students took it up, and
once came in collision with that Tiziano
of Cadore, who they say broke a boat-hook
over the head of one of them who had
spoken ill of the Master.</p>

<p>But this did not silence the talk, and
one dark night, when the air was full
of flying mist, one of Pascale’s students
came to me and told me that he wanted
me to take a party over to Murano. The
weather was so bad that I refused to go—the
wind blew in gusts, sheet lightning
filled the Eastern sky, and all honest men,
but poor belated gondoliers, had hied
them home.</p>

<p>I refused to go.</p>

<p>Had I not seen Gian the painter go not
half an hour before? Well, if he could
go, others could too.</p>

<p>I refused to go—except for double fare.
</p><p>He accepted and placed the double fare
in silver in my palm. Then he gave a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page125" id="page125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
whistle and from behind the corners came
trooping enough swashbuckler students
to swamp my gondola. I let in just enough
to fill the seats and pushed off, leaving
several standing on the stone steps cursing
me and everything and everybody.</p>

<p>As my boat slid away in the fog and
headed on our course, I glanced back
and saw the three barca-loads following
in my wake.</p>

<p>There was much muffled talk, and orders
from some one in charge to keep silence.
But there was passing of strong drink,
and then talk, and from it I gathered
that these were all students from Pascale’s,
out on one of those student carousals,
intent on heaven knows what! It was
none of my business.</p>

<p>We shipped considerable water, and some
of the students were down on their knees
praying and bailing, bailing and praying.
</p><p>At last we reached the Murano landing.
All got out, the barcas tied up, and I tied
up, too, determined to see what was doing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page126" id="page126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
The strong drink was passed, and a low,
heavy-set fellow who seemed to be captain
charged all not to speak, but to follow
him and do as he did.</p>

<p>We took a side street where there was
little travel and followed through the dark
and dripping way, fully a half-mile, down
there in that end of the island called the
sailors’ broglio, where they say no man’s
life is safe if he has a silver coin or two.
There was much music in the wine-shops
and shouts of mirth and dancing feet on
stone floors, but the rain had driven
every one from the streets.</p>

<p>We came to a long, low, stone building
that used to be a theater, but was now
a dance-hall upstairs and a warehouse
below. There were lights upstairs and
sounds of music. The stairway was dark,
but we felt our way up and on tiptoe
advanced to the big double door, from
under which the light streamed.</p>

<p>We had received our orders, and when
we got to the landing we stood there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page127" id="page127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
just an instant. “Now we have him—Gian
the hypocrite!” whispered the stout
man in a hoarse breath. We burst in the
doors with a whoop and a bang. The
change from the dark to the light sort
of blinded us at first. We all supposed
that there was a dance in progress of
course, and the screams from women
were just what we expected; but when
we saw several overturned easels and an
old man, half-nude, and too scared to
move, seated on a model throne, we did
not advance into the hall as we intended.
That one yell we gave was all the noise
we made. We stood there in a bunch,
just inside the door, sort of dazed and
uncertain. We did not know whether to
retreat, or charge on through the hall
as we had intended. We just stood there
like a lot of driveling fools.</p>

<p>“Keep right at your work, my good
people. Keep right at your work!” called
a pleasant voice. “I see we have some
visitors.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page128" id="page128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
And Gian Bellini came forward. His robe
was still tucked up under the blue sash,
but he had laid aside his black cap, and
his tumbled gray hair looked like the
aureole of a saint. “Keep right at your
work,” he said again, and then came
forward and bade us welcome and begged
us to have seats.</p>

<p>I dared not run away, so I sat down on
one of the long seats that were ranged
around the wall. My companions did the
same. There must have been fifty easels,
all ranged in a semicircle around the old
man who posed as a model. Several of
the easels had been upset, and there was
much confusion when we entered.</p>

<p>“Just help us to arrange things—that is
right, thank you,” said Gian to the stout
man who was captain of our party. To
my astonishment the stout man was doing
just as he was bid, and was pacifying the
women students and straightening up
their easels and stools.</p>

<p>I was interested in watching Gian walking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page129" id="page129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
around, helping this one with a stroke of
his crayon, saying a word to that, smiling
and nodding to another. I just sat there
and stared. These students were not
regular art students, I could see that
plainly. Some were children, ragged and
barelegged, others were old men who
worked in the glass-factories, and surely
with hands too old and stiff to ever paint
well. Still others were women and young
girls of the town. I rubbed my eyes
and tried to make it out!</p>

<p>The music we heard I could still hear—it
came from the wine-shop across the
way. I looked around and what do you
believe? My companions had all gone.
They had sneaked out one by one and
left me alone.</p>

<p>I watched my chance and when the
Master’s back was turned I tiptoed out,
too.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I got down on the street I found
I had left my cap, but I dared not go back
after it. I made my way down to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page130" id="page130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
landing, half running, and when I got
there not a boat was to be seen—the
three barcas and my gondola were gone.</p>

<p>I thought I could see them, out through
the mist, a quarter of a mile away. I called
aloud, but no answer came back but the
hissing wind. I was in despair—they were
stealing my boat, and if they did not steal
it, it would surely be wrecked—my all,
my precious boat!</p>

<p>I cried and wrung my hands. I prayed!
And the howling winds only ran shrieking
and laughing around the corners of the
building.</p>

<p>I saw a glimmering light down the beach
at a little landing. I ran to it, hoping some
gondolier might be found who would row
me over to the city. There was one boat
at the landing and in it a hunchback,
sound asleep, covered with a canvas. It
was Gian Bellini’s boat. I shook the
hunchback into wakefulness and begged
him to row me across to the city. I yelled
into his deaf ears, but he pretended not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page131" id="page131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to understand me. Then I showed him
the silver coin—the double fare—and
tried to place it in his hand. But no,
he only shook his head.</p>

<p>I ran up the beach, still looking for a
boat.</p>

<hr />

<p>An hour had passed.</p>

<p>I got back to the landing just as Gian
came down to his boat.</p>

<p>I approached him and explained that
I was a poor worker in the glass-factory,
who had to work all day and
half the night, and as I lived over in
the city and my wife was dying, I must
get home. Would he allow me to ride
with His Highness? “Certainly—with
pleasure, with pleasure!” he answered,
and then pulling something from under
his sash he said, “Is this your cap,
Signor?” I took my cap, but my tongue
was paralyzed for the moment so I could
not thank him.</p>

<p>The wind had died down, the rain had
ceased, and from between the blue-black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page132" id="page132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
clouds the moon shone out. Gian rowed
with a strong, fine stroke, singing a “Te
Deum Laudamus” softly to himself the
while.</p>

<p>I lay there and wept, thinking of my
boat, my all, my precious boat!</p>

<p>We reached the landing—and there was
my boat, safely tied up, not a cushion
nor a cord missing.</p>

<p>Gian Bellini? He may be a rogue as
Pascale Salvini says—God knows! How
can I tell—I am only a poor gondolier!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page133" id="page133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
So here then endeth the Volume entitled
“The Mintage,” the same being Ten
Stories and One More written by Elbert
Hubbard. The whole done into a printed
book by The Roycrofters at their Shop,
which is in the Village of East Aurora,
Erie County, New York State, this year

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
